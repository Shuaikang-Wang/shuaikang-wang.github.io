I am a second year Master student at [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/)(PKU), where I work with [Prof. Meng Guo](https://mengguo.github.io/personal_site/).
I received my Bachelor's degree in Robotics Engineering from the [College of Engineering](http://en.coe.pku.edu.cn/) at [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/) in 2023. During the undergraduate, I was lucky to study as an exchange student at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/).

My research interests lie at the intersection of decision-making, learning, and control in robotic systems. I focus on enhancing the efficiency, safety, and flexibility of robots in complex tasks.
